# On the spot

**Problem:**

Many of the problems in society, trivial or non-trivial, go unreported behind the veil of ignorance or lack of knowledge of responsible authorities. Most of the departments in our modern society have defined SLAs for their operations but the corrective action is delayed because of lack of any platform to report such incidents to the authorities. &quot;On the Spot&quot; is a solution to this problem as it will serve as a platform to report such problems without prior knowledge of responsible authorities. The proposal is to create a mobile application which should be simple enough to be used by the mass and with minimal steps to follow. The application could be integrated with the social media for sharing the feedback of the authorities and the provided resolution. The platform will aid the citizens in fulfilling their civic duty; the actions of an individual must benefit the whole of society.

**Solutions:**

We have developed an android app which can help report common incidents such as broken street light, or unrepaired potholes etc. The citizens can sign-up using their smartphones and whenever they come across any such incident they can log complaint on the app. The backend systems implicitly route the incident details consisting of the location, description and the image to the concerned authorities thereby notifying them in real-time. By implementing this solution, we can significantly lower down the time and efforts required in order to report such incidents to their respective authorities.
