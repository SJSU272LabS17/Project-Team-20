Topic 1:

On the Spot</B></U>

Many of the problems in society, trivial or non-trivial, go unreported behind the veil of ignorance or lack of knowledge of responsible authorities. Most of the departments in our modern society have defined SLAs for their operations but the corrective action is delayed because of lack of any platform to report such incidents to the authorities.
“On the Spot” is a solution to this problem as it will serve as a platform to report such problems without prior knowledge of responsible authorities. The proposal is to create a mobile application which should be simple enough to be used by the mass and with minimal steps to follow. Please find below the proposal:

•	If anyone wants to report a fault, say a faulty traffic light, one would take a picture and write a one line description of the problem. <br>
•	The application will use machine learning to identify the objects in the picture and will try to relate it to keywords in description.<br>
•	Then application will search for the nearest located authorities responsible for the corrective actions and the problem will be forwarded to the authorities with problem location, incident picture, and description.<br>
•	The person will be informed about the organization to which the report was forwarded to.<br>

The application could be integrated with the social media for sharing the feedback of the authorities and the provided resolution. The platform will aid the citizens in fulfilling their civic duty; the actions of an individual must benefit the whole of society.

Topic 2:

RENTIFY</B></U>

People work hard for money, so spending it on things that just aren't worth is a total waste. When it comes down to it, we're better off putting our cash toward some expenses than throwing it away on others. In that scenario, one can rent an item for required time and return it once done. Currently, there is no general-purpose platform (most are domain specific) available for lending and renting things.<br><br>
RENTIFY mobile application will facilitate such scenario by providing lenders and borrowers with a shared platform. Please find below the proposed process flow:<br><br>
•	Lender will post an advertisement for renting out goods with complete item description and quoted rent per hour. <br>
•	Anyone who wants to rent an item will search for it and would get a result of all the lenders in a mile’s radius. The search could be extended if required.<br>
•	If the two parties agree on the mutual terms, then deal will be fixed for a fixed time.<br>
•	The transaction will be executed with the billing amount.<br>
•	The borrowers and lenders will be provided with credit scores based on their dealings.<br>
